A man went to a market and purchased a wolf, a goat, and a cabbage. On his way home, the man came to the bank of a river and rented a boat. But crossing the river by boat, the man could carry only himself and a single one of his purchases: the wolf, the goat, or the cabbage.

If left unattended together, the wolf would eat the goat, or the goat would eat the cabbage.

The man's challenge was to carry himself and his purchases to the far bank of the river, leaving each purchase intact. How did he do it?
